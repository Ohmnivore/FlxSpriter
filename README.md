# Downloads
* [Releases](https://github.com/Ohmnivore/FlxSpriter/releases "Releases")

# Notes
* Windows-only for the time being
* All "simple" image formats like .png, .jpeg, .bmp are supported
* .psd works, but I can't guarantee that image formats generated by other image-editing software work too

FlxSpriter is a tool designed to complement various image-editing software. It allows you to view the resulting animation of the sprite you're editing on the fly.

# Features:
* Sprite live-reload: Just keep on drawing, FlxSpriter will update its own copy of the graphic in a split second
* Handles all sorts of formats: FlxSpriter converts your image to .png silently when it live-reloads, so you can continue editing in your image-editing software
* Always-on top window (launch with windowTopMost.exe and toggle on/off with Ctrl-Space): Allows you to see the animation without switching windows
* XML data: All of your sprite's metadata is parsed from a single XML file
* Multiple sprites and animations at a time
* Change background color, animation speed, or pause an animation and navigate individual frames

# QuickStart
Check out the "sample" directory. To import a sprite, select the "File" menu, and then select "import sprite". Finally, select the XML file you need. Here's an example of XML sprite metadata:
	`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<data>
		<opt bgColor="0x000000" scale="3" />
		<img src="charsPsd.psd" width="32" height="32" />
		<anim name="idle" rate="12" frames="24, 25, 26, 27" />
	</data>`

* bgColor: the color displayed under the sprite
* scale: X and Y scale multiplier
* src: the image's path (relative to the XML file)
* width and height: sizes of an individual frame, not of the entire spritesheet
* name: make sure the animation names are unique
* rate: animation's frames per second
* frames: comma-separated list of frame IDs (frame 0 is at the top-left, frame 1 is to the right of frame 0)

# TODO:
* Test complex image formats
* Linux + Mac builds
